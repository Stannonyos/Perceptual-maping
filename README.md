# Perceptual-maping

Perceptual map create a visual representation of customers and attributes that are being measured. Attributes could run across different variables.
For example from a list of banks, what perception do customers have on each bank.
Since perception maps depend on more than one variables, the best techniques for analysis are perhaps multivariate such as principal component analysis,
and correspondence analysis. PCA is best suited in situations where attributes are measured interms of scale while correspondence analysis would work best
where attributes are categorical e.g. yes/no questions.

In my example I have a data of 14 banks (Bank A to Bank O) and different attributes being measured. Since the scale is categorical, correspondence analysis has been used for analysis.
